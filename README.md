# Yougnoli learns..
This repository is a personal library of what I have learned, am learning, would like to learn. It is a way to monitor if I am focusing on the right things and if I am investing my time optimally.

[Here](https://github.com/yougnoli/Learns/blob/main/learning.json) you can find the json with all the courses I am following or the books I am reading. [Here](https://github.com/yougnoli/Learns/blob/main/read-learning.sql) you can find a SQL Server query that allows you to see the output in table form.
